programs to convert file formats


Hello! Thanks for trying out my programs!

step 1: 

Clone these programs to a folder on your computer. 

```
git clone git@github.com:CoderMB1138/python_video_converters.git

```
Step 2:

Open a terminal in the same folder or use GUI to create 'clips' and 'output' folders.

```
mkdir clips output
```

Step 3:
Load desired clips {.MOV, .WMV, .MPEG format} & select desired program. Run on Ubuntu with command:

```
python3 name_of_program.py

```
Batches of clips can be handled! But please onlly convert one file type at a time. For Example, only load .wmv clips into the clips folder and then select the clip_converter_wmv2mpeg4.py program. 
Other formats will be ignored!

Enjoy!
